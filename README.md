# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-w-ML

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict the progression of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. 

The dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes various biomedical voice measurements from individuals with Parkinson's disease, will serve as the primary data source. 

The goal is to recreate and improve identifying patterns and key indicators that aid in early diagnosis and monitoring the progression of the disease.

## Objectives
Analyze biomedical voice measurements to extract significant features related to Parkinson's disease.

Develop a machine learning model to classify individuals with and without Parkinson's disease accurately.

Predict the severity and progression of Parkinson's disease in patients over time.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: normalize, and transform the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize data to understand patterns and correlations.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for predicting Parkinson's disease.

Model Development: Build and train machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

Model Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the models.

Interpretation: Analyze model results to gain insights into disease progression.

## Expected Outcomes
A robust machine learning model capable of higher-accuracy classification of Parkinson's disease.

Insights into key indicators and patterns associated with Parkinson's disease progression.

A framework for further research in medical diagnosis using machine learning.
